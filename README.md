**Advanced Python Assignments**


Part I: Process Automation

1.Create a file that contains 1000 lines of random strings.

2.Create a file that contains multiple lines of random strings, and the file size must be 5 MB.

3.Create 10 files that contain multiple lines of random strings, and the file size of each file must be 5 MB.

4.Create 5 files of sizes 1GB, 2GB, 3GB, 4GB, and 5GB. Each file contains multiple lines of random strings.

5.Convert all the files from Q4 into uppercase, one by one.

6.Convert all the files from Q4 into uppercase in parallel using multi-threading.

7.Write a program to automatically download 10 images of cats from “Google Images”. (Hint: Find the package from pypi.org and use it.)

8.Write a program to automatically download 10 videos about "Machine Learning" from YouTube. (Hint: Find the package from pypi.org and use it.)

9.Convert all the videos from Q8 to audio. (Hint: Find the package from pypi.org and use it.)

10.Create an automated multi-threaded pipeline for:

Automatically downloading 100 videos from YouTube → Convert them to audio

11.Create an automated multi-threaded pipeline for:

Automatically downloading 500 images of Dogs from Google Images → Rescale them to 50%

Part II: Data Analytics

12Create a random dataset of 100 rows and 30 columns. All values range between [1, 200]. Perform the following operations:
(i) Replace all values between [10, 60] with NA. Print the count of rows having missing values.
(ii) Replace all the NA values with the average of the column.
(iii) Find the Pearson correlation among all columns and plot a heatmap. Also, select columns with correlation <= 0.7.
(iv) Normalize all the values in the dataset between 0 and 10.
(v) Replace all values in the dataset with 1 if value <= 0.5, otherwise with 0.

13.Create a random dataset of 500 rows and 10 columns:

Columns 1–4: Values in range [-10, 10]

Columns 5–8: Values in range [10, 20]

Columns 9–10: Values in range [-100, 100]

Apply the following clustering algorithms, determine the optimal number of clusters, and plot the distance metric graph for each:

(i) K-Means Clustering

(ii) Hierarchical Clustering

14.Create a random dataset of 600 rows and 15 columns. All values range between [-100, 100]. Perform the following:
(i) Plot a Scatter Graph between Column 5 and Column 6.
(ii) Plot a Histogram of each column in a single graph.
(iii) Plot the Box Plot of each column in a single graph.

15.Create a random dataset of 500 rows and 5 columns. All values range between [5, 10]. Perform the following statistical analyses:
(i) Perform a t-test on each column.
(ii) Perform a Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test on each column.
(iii) Perform a Two Sample t-Test and Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test on Column 3 and Column 4.
